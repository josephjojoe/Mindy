# Mindy
A no-nonsense minimal bot. Keeping it simple with moderation and utility commands, and nothing else. Mindy is written in discord.py.

## Invite
To invite Mindy to your server, click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=750245181667934219&permissions=8&scope=bot). Mindy currently requires Administrator privileges, although this is likely to change under the principle of least privilege as more commands are added. 

Note: You need the 'Manage Servers' permission to be able to add bots to your server.

## How to use
Mindy's command prefix is `mindy`. You can use it as such: `mindy [command]`.
